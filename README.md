## Description

The Python Piscine is a structured, multi-module Python specialization within Milestone 2 of the 42 curriculum.
It progresses from foundational syntax to object-oriented design, data processing, and file persistence through layered, interconnected projects.

This repository documents my progression through the Python Piscine modules.

## Modules Overview

| Module | Version | Focus | Key Concepts Learned |
|--------|---------|--------|----------------------|
| Module 00 | v2.1 | Python Fundamentals | Variables, expressions, control flow, functions, input validation, logical structuring |
| Module 01 | v2.2 | Object-Oriented Programming | Classes, objects, encapsulation, method design, modular architecture |
| Module 02 | v2.1 | Data Engineering | Data pipelines, error handling, resilient processing, structured data handling |
| Module 03 | v2.3 | Advanced Data Structures | Lists, dictionaries, sets, iteration patterns, analytics-style data processing |
| Module 04 | — | File Operations & Persistence | File I/O, data preservation, structured storage, state management |

## Technical Skills Developed

Throughout the Piscine, I strengthened my ability to:

- Write clean, modular, and readable Python code  
- Design and implement object-oriented systems  
- Process and transform structured data  
- Handle exceptions and edge cases effectively  
- Work with files and persistent data  
- Apply abstraction and code reuse principles  
- Follow Pythonic conventions and best practices

## Technical Growth

The Python Piscine marked a shift from low-level procedural thinking to higher-level abstraction and system design.

It reinforced:

- Problem decomposition  
- Code organization  
- Defensive programming  
- Writing maintainable and scalable logic
